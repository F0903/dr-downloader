A library for downloading episodes from DR-TV, with extra utilities for converting them from HLS to anything you'd like through FFMPEG.

For the CLI (command line interface), visit [dr-downloader-cli](https://github.com/F0903/dr-downloader-cli).

Note:
This program will most likely only work in Denmark, as DR has restrictions on who can access their content.
Use of this program assumes you have the right to download the relevant media.
