A library for downloading episodes from DR-TV.
For the CLI, visit [dr-downloader-cli](https://github.com/F0903/dr-downloader-cli).

Note:
This program will most likely only work in Denmark, as DR has restrictions on who can access their content.
Use of this program assumes you have the right to download the relevant media.
