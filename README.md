# dr-downloader
A downloader that downloads media from DR (Denmarks Radio) in parallel, and converts them to convenient MP4 files.
To use, simply paste in an episode or season url from DRTV.

Note: 
This program will most likely only work in Denmark, as DR has restrictions on who can access their content.
